# TextBraTS

A text-image public dataset with novel text-guided 3D brain tumor segmentation.

---

## Introduction

**TextBraTS** is an open-access dataset designed to advance research in text-guided 3D brain tumor segmentation. It includes paired multi-modal brain MRI scans and expertly annotated radiology reports, enabling the development and evaluation of multi-modal deep learning models that bridge vision and language in neuro-oncology.

## Features

- Multi-modal 3D brain MRI scans (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR)
- Expert-annotated tumor segmentations
- Structured radiology reports for each case
- Text-image alignment for research on multi-modal fusion

## Usage

You can use this dataset for:
- Developing and benchmarking text-guided segmentation models
- Evaluating multi-modal fusion algorithms in medical imaging
- Research in language-driven medical AI
